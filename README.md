## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the project, you need:
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) installed on your system or the provided Maven wrapper (`mvnw`).
- Java 23 or later.

### Steps to Build and Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Use Maven to build the project:
   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```
   This will package and install the artifacts for the three subprojects (client, server, and shared).
3. To start the server:
   ```
   cd server
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
4. To start the client:
   ```
   cd client
   mvn javafx:run
   ```

### First actions
- To start using the app and taking notes, you must create your first collection. You can do this by selecting the ```All notes``` dropdown label and then selecting ```Add Collection```, or by pressing ```CTRL + N```, and then entering a valid name and server.
- To create your first note, click on the ```Add Note``` button to the right of the ```All notes``` dropdown label.

- View all existing notes on the server.
- Create, edit, and delete notes with unique titles.
- Synchronize note changes automatically with the server.
- Markdown support, including a rendered preview.
- Search for notes by keywords.

- Create, connect, edit, or delete collections.
- Filter notes by collection or view all collections simultaneously.
- Migrate collections between servers.
- Server status indicators for collection operations (e.g., server unreachable, collection exists).
- Configuration persisted locally using JSON.
### Meaningful addition
- **Multi-server** functionality is implemented, together with a set of extra actions regarding collections, including:
    - creating new collections;
    - connecting to already existing collections
    - deleting collections;
    - forgetting a collection from the client, without deleting it on the server
    - migrating collections from one server to another

### 3. Embedded Files
- Embed files (e.g., images) into notes.
- Rename and delete embedded files.
- Automatically remove embedded files when deleting a note.
- Refer to embedded images in Markdown previews.

- Link notes using `[[Note Title]]` syntax, with automatic updates on title changes.
- Render links and tags in Markdown previews for easy navigation.
- Visual indicators for unresolved references or missing tags.
- Multi-tag filtering with intuitive dropdown suggestions.

### Meaningful addition

### 5. Automated Change Synchronization
- Real-time synchronization of changes, including:
    - Note content.
    - Note addition or deletion.
    - Title updates.
    - Embedded file changes.
- WebSocket-based push updates ensure efficiency.

### Meaningful addition
- Changes made to Embedded files are also synchronized

---

### 6. Live Language Switching
- Change the application language at runtime.
- Persist language preferences across sessions.
- Supports English, Dutch, and an additional proof-of-concept language.
- Language indicator with flag icons for easy identification.

### Meaningful addition
- Added a fourth language

---

## HCI
1. A high-contrast mode was implemented, which can be toggled on and off using the button at the bottom of the app.
2. Tooltips have been added to all icon-buttons in order to clearly inform the user about the actions of these buttons.

---

## Other considerations
1. As per the requirements, the ```config.json``` and ```markdown.css``` files can be found:
    - At ```"C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\NetNote\"```on Windows;
    - At ```"home/username/.netnote/``` on Linux and Mac;
   
    And can be edited by the user.
